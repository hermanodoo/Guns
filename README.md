Guns


#2. Main Goal

The main goal of this toy project is for me to familiarize with Java.
I focused on creating fields and methods that give each class its own characteristics.
Also getting comfortable with creating flow of logics.
Plus making sure there weren't any redundant extra codes.

#3. Project Explanation

The code contains three classes 
- Gun
- ShootTest
- AmmoBox

Gun class has fields that are gun's characteristic.
Such as what type of gun it is, the full reload capacity, and current bullet numbers.

AmmoBox class simply shows how many bullets left in the ammmo box.

ShootTest class create brings those Gun and AmmoBox templates.
It contains following methods:

- boxLeft() : shows number of bullets left in the ammo box
- ammoLeft() : shows number of bullets left in the gun including chamber
- reload() : reloads the gun
- shoot() : shoots the gun
